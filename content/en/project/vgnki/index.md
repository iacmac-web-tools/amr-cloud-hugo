### Russian State Center for Quality and Standardization of Veterinary Drugs and Feed

Research Institute of the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (ROSSELKHOZNADZOR).

OIE collaborating Center on Food Safety, Diagnosis and Control of Animal Diseases in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Transcaucasia.

Main activities of VGNKI are ensuring veterinary drugs quality, food of animal origin and feed safety, certification and registration of veterinary drugs, feed and feed additives, including GMO-containing.

### Abstract:

We present the data on antimicrobial resistance of animal zoonotic bacteria isolates from different regions of Russia to over than 50 antimicrobials from 12 different groups.

#### Object: 

Isolates of E.coli, Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Enterococcus spp. taken from biomaterial of farm animals (poultry, cattle, reindeer, swine), food and feed materials.

#### Method of AST: 

Broth microdilution (standard EUCAST/ISO/CLSI protocol), Sensititre veterinary custom plates.

#### Breakpoints: 

Microbiological end-points â€“ EUCAST ECOFFs (https://mic.eucast.org/Eucast2/, ver. 5.26), EUCAST Clinical Breakpoints (ver. 2019), CLSI Clinical Breakpoints (Standards M100S28, VET01S 3rd ed.)

#### Methods of gene analysis:

Whole-genome sequencing (Illumina Miseq).
