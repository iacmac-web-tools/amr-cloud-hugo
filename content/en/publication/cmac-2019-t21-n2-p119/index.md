abstract: "Antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to global public health and requires closer attention from the medical community. Antibiotic resistance monitoring systems play a key role in observing the antimicrobial susceptibility changes for rational prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Most current systems use data on a global scale; however, local data evaluation is more important for practical application. Unique AMRcloud online platform (https://amrcloud.net) was developed to process user data on antimicrobial resistance. Structural modules are modified to address the needs of researchers. The application has powerful graphic capabilities, data analysis system with automated interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Geocoding is performed in a double way, and information exchange of results is adjusted by user. The use of AMRcloud allows researchers to create their own methodology for organizing primary data and their evaluation."
