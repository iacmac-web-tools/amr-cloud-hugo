&lt;li&gt;Password – is required for your authentication and access to AMRcloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please, note that Administration does not store passwords in the public domain and cannot use your user account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set cookies on each our webpage to collect anonymous analytics data. We use this information to help operate our resource and do not convey or sell it to any third parties. The information gathered may include:&lt;/p&gt;
