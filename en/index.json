Each isolate record should be represented by a separate row in the table. All AST Data and Metadata should be organized in columns with each column representing only a single type of data (number, date, character string). The Metadata must include four mandatory columns: Isolate Identifier, Organism/Species Name, Organism Group, and Date. All other metadata (e.g. geographical data, resistance markers, etc.) is optional. The AST Data may be of three different types: minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), inhibition zone diameters, and susceptibility categories (S/I/R). Headers of the columns representing AST Data should contain a generic name of antimicrobial agent and one of the three suffixes (\u0026quot;_mic\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;_dd\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;_sir\u0026rdquo;) denoting each type of data.

An example data file for use as a reference for data formatting can be downloaded from a link at the bottom of the \u0026ldquo;Read Me\u0026rdquo; tab.\n  Downloading a sample data   Basic Requirements The data should be in the required format to be handled by AMRcloud.\n The data table should be flat (i.e. it should contain columns and rows with no additional separators, no hierarchical structures).   Data table structure    The first row of the table must be a header row with column names.   Header row    The table should contain four mandatory metadata columns (although the column names may be different):   Isolate Identifier (ID) Organism/Species Name Organism Group Date    Mandatory columns   Isolate ID Isolate ID can be any combination of alphanumeric characters, except special symbols (?,!,%$#\u0026gt;\u0026lt;), and can be non-unique. Records (rows) with empty ID field are not imported.\nOrganism/Species Name Only the Latin binomial names should be used for microbial species (see the official nomenclature https://lpsn.dsmz.de/). Abbreviations in the species names are not allowed. Proper genus and species names are automatically recognized to determine susceptibility categories to antimicrobial agents using specific breakpoints.\n Right:\nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae\nWrong:\nS. aureus, S. pneumoniae\n Organism Group Any taxonomic or non-taxonomic, full or abbreviated names can be used to define Organism Groups, however the names shoud be consistent throughout the column. Grouping of organisms (species) is used for analyzing combined statistics (e.g. resistance prevalence) of several species.\n Right:\nEnterobacterales, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes, Enterobacterales, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes (all names are standardized)\nWrong:\nEnterobact, Staph, Entbact, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes, Gram-neg anaerobes (names are not standardized)\n Date The import wizard can automatically detect and interpret various Date formats, however, the Date format must be consistent throughout the column.

The quantitative AST Data (MIC and inhibition zone values) for the known antibiotics are automatically interpreted into susceptibility categories using selected criteria (breakpoints).   List of legitimate antibiotic names    Other (arbitrary) names of antimicrobial agents can be used in the column headers, however, quantitative AST Data for such agents are not translated into suceptibility categories. If you want to use alternative criteria (breakpoints) for certain antimicrobial agents, you can modify their names as shown in the examples below:\n amoxicillin-clavulanic acid_clsi_mic, moxifloxacin_clsi_sir, marbofloxacin_veterinary_sir\n   The requirements for the format of AST Data entries are as follows:\n  Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Values\n MIC values are measured in mg/L. Values must be numeric. Non-numeric values containing expressions \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; are automatically converted into numeric. Symbols \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; preceding the numbers are removed. Numbers preceded by \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; symbol are multiplied by two.    Disk Diffusion Inhibition Zone Diameter Values\n Inhibition Zone Diameter values are measured in mm. Values must be integers greater than or equal to six.    Susceptibility Category Values\n The only allowed values are \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;. Values such as \u0026ldquo;S/I\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I/R\u0026rdquo; are not allowed.    Additional Matadata In addition to Mandatory Columns and AST Data, you table may include other optional columns with information about sources of isolates (including geospatial data), patient clinical and demographic data, specific characteristics of isolates (including phenotypic and genotypic resistance markers), etc. These columns will be used as parameters for data selection, filtration and categorization.\nSpatial Information Column(s)\nSpatial Information includes geographic objects (geolocations) and, optionally, their coordinates (latitude and longitude). You may provide various types of objects as geolocations: countries, regions, states, natural areas, cities, smaller locality types or even detailed addresses (e.g. hospital buildings). At Step Three of the data import wizard, an automatic geocoding is performed to assign geographic coordinates to the known geolocations. You can also do it manually if automatic geocoding did not work.\nIf your data table already contains the two columns with latitude and longitude coordinates, you can check the box and then select these columns at Step One of the data import wizard.\nText (String) Metadata Columns\nYou can import a maximum of ten parameters (columns) containing text metadata (including the column with geographic names) to a single Data Set.\nNumeric Metadata Column\nYou can import one parameter (column) containing continuous numeric variable such as \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;, etc. Please note that if you use numeric parameter, all cells in the column must be filled in with the number, records (rows) with empty numeric field are not imported.\nResistance Markers Columns\nResistance Markers may represent any isolate characteristics (phenotypes, complex genotypes, genes or mutations) that are relevant to antibiotic resistance. Markers can be assigned to groups with each Group of Markers set in a separate column.

To do so, you need to associate the column headers with the standard categories (Isolate ID, Organism Group, Organism Name, and Date) required by AMRcloud. You can also select additional columns with spatial data, other metadata and resistance markers to be used as Fields.\nThe required categories (with brief accompanying instructions) are listed on the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen, you should choose the corresponding column headers from the drop-down lists. As you proceed with selection, you will be able to preview the content of the first ten rows of each selected column.\n  Linking the columns to categories   Isolate ID  This is a mandatory category. Isolate ID can be any combination of alphanumeric characters, except special symbols (?,.!%$#\u0026gt;\u0026lt;).  Organism Group  This is a desirable category. You can use any names for organism groups, full taxonomic (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staphylococcus\u0026rdquo;), non-taxonomic (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staphylococci\u0026rdquo;) or abbreviated (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staph\u0026rdquo;), however the names shoud be consistent throughout the column. Grouping of organisms (species) is useful for analyzing combined prevalence and AST data of several species.  Organism/Species Name  This is a mandatory category. Use Latin binomial names acoording to official nomenclature (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/). Proper genus and species names are automatically recognized to apply specific breakpoints and to determine susceptibility categories.   Right:\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (full binomial names)\nWrong:\nK. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa (abbreviated names)\n Select the Species name column from the drop-down list, and press the \u0026ldquo;Check Species Names\u0026rdquo; button to verify the names.\n  Checking species names   A list of species names that are not recognized may appear below the button. There may be two reasons for the name(s) to fail the verification process:\n  There are spelling errors (e.g. missing, incorrect letters etc.). Spell-check the name(s) carefully, correct the error(s) by double-clicking and editing the name(s) directly in the list, then press the \u0026ldquo;Correct species names\u0026rdquo; button.\n  Outdated or invalid species name is used. Try searching the name at https://lpsn.dsmz.de/ or at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/ and replace it with the correct one.\n   Example #1. \u0026ldquo;Enterobacter aerogenes\u0026rdquo; is the old name for \u0026ldquo;Klebsiella aerogenes\u0026quot;.\n  Interpretive criteria (S/I/R breakpoints) are missing for a particular organism/species in the AMRcloud database. In this case, no correction is needed; species name will be imported \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;.   Example #2. The species name \u0026ldquo;Burkholderia cepacia\u0026rdquo; is correct but is not recognized because EUCAST breakpoints are missing for this species.\n  If the full species name is not recognized, the data import wizard will attempt to determine the genus part of the name and, where possible, will apply the corresponding genus-specific breakpoints to the isolates\u0026rsquo; quantitative AST data. If neither a species nor a genus name is found in the AMRcloud susceptibility breakpoint database, the corresponding isolate record(s) will be imported, but quantitative susceptibility data will not be translated to S/I/R categories.\n Example #3. If \u0026ldquo;Salmonella Typhimurium\u0026rdquo; is used as species name (for \u0026ldquo;Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium\u0026rdquo;), the genus-specific breakpoints of Salmonella will be applied.\n   Date  This is a mandatory category. The date format must be consistent throughout the column. Records without a date or with a different date format will not be imported.   Right:\n12.08.2018, 20.05.2017, 16.03.2014 (same format DD.MM.YYYY)\nWrong:\n13.08.2018, 20/05/19, 03/16/2014 (inconsistent format DD.MM.YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY)\n   Incorrect date format   After selecting the Date column from the drop-down list, you should see the time scale under the \u0026ldquo;Date Range Privew\u0026rdquo;. If the date format is not recognized with the Auto option, try selecting alternative date formats. Be sure to check the box when you see the time scale.\n  Confirming the date column selection   Spatial Information  This is not a mandatory category. Spatial information includes geographic locations and, optionally, their latitude/longitude coordinates. You may provide various types of objects as geolocations: countries, regions, states, natural areas, cities, smaller locality types or even detailed addresses (e.g. hospital buildings).  Check the box if your data set contains spatial information and select the header of the column with geographic locations from the drop-down list.\nThe coordinates of geolocations can be set automatically or manually at Step Three of the data import wizard. However, if your data table already contains the two columns with latitude and longitude coordinates, check the corresponding box and then select these columns.\n  Spatial information   Numeric Parameter  This is not a mandatory category. Only one column containing continuous numeric variable such as \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;, etc. can be selected. If you use numeric parameter, all cells in the column must be filled in with the number, isolate records (rows) with empty numeric field are not imported.  Check the box if you data set contains numeric parameter and select the corresponding column header from the drop-down list.\n  Numeric parameter   Resistance Markers  This is not a mandatory category. Resistance Markers may represent any isolate characteristics (phenotypes, complex genotypes, genes or mutations) that are relevant to antibiotic resistance. Markers can be assigned to groups with each group of Markers set in a separate column. The total number of columns of this type is unlimited.  Check the box if you data set contains resistance markers data and select the corresponding column header(s) from the drop-down list.\n  Resistance markers   Additional Parameters  This is not a mandatory category.

This project presents the following data on nosocomial A. baumannii isolates collected from various regions of Russia:\n isolate source data (geographical, clinical data, and basic patient demographics); molecular-genetic characteristics of isolates (clonal group, SNP type, sequence type, KL type, presence of acquired carbapenemase genes); susceptibility to various antibiotics; susceptibility to certain lytic phages.  Bacterial isolates The study includes a total of 2,535 consecutive non-duplicate (one per patient/case of infection) clinical isolates collected between 14 January 2013 and 25 December 2018 as part of the national surveillance studies from 61 hospitals in 32 cities of Russia: Arkhangelsk, Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok, Voronezh, Yekaterinburg, Izhevsk, Kazan, Kislovodsk, Krasnodar, Maykop, Moscow, Murmansk, Naberezhnye Chelny, Novosibirsk, Noyabrsk, Omsk, Penza, Perm, Petrozavodsk, Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, Seversk, Smolensk, Tver, Tolyatti, Tomsk, Tula, Tyumen, Ulan-Ude, Chelyabinsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and Yakutsk.\nAntibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics were determined by reference broth microdilution method according to ISO 20776-1:2006. The susceptibility categories were interpreted according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC Clinical Breakpoints v.9.0, 2019 (http://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/)\nPhage susceptibility testing (PST) Susceptibilities of isolates to selected lytic phages were determined by a modified double-agar-layer method and by spot testing. The results are interpreted as follows: S – lysis by phage; I – partial lysis; R – resistance to phage. PST results are presented together with AST results.\nMolecular-genetic subtyping  All isolates were typed by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing assay based on high-throughput real-time PCR detection of 21informative SNPs in 10 chromosomal loci: gltA, recA, cpn60, gyrB, gdhB, rpoD, fusA, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB (http://snpt.antibiotic.ru:9002/). Selected isolates were typed by both the Oxford and Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes using Sanger or whole genome sequencing (https://pubmlst.org/abaumannii/).  Identification of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters (K-loci, KL) KL types were identified for selected isolates from WGS data using the standard database and nomenclature (https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive).\nDetection of acquired carbapenemase genes The genes of the most prevalent in Acinetobacter spp. acquired carbapenemases of molecular class D (OXA-23-, OXA-24/40- and OXA-58-like), class А (GES-2- or GES-5-like), and class B (VIM, IMP and NDM) were determined by means of real-time PCR.\nStudy group Roman S.

Antibiotic resistance monitoring systems play a key role in observing the antimicrobial susceptibility changes for rational prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Most current systems use data on a global scale; however, local data evaluation is more important for practical application. Unique AMRcloud online platform (https://amrcloud.net) was developed to process user data on antimicrobial resistance. Structural modules are modified to address the needs of researchers. The application has powerful graphic capabilities, data analysis system with automated interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results.
