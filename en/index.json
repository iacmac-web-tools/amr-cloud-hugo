The data visualized in the Infographics field can be filtered to only display a data subset by using filters at the top of the screen. Below is the description of the structures of those two main modules.\nBasic filters field The metadata from your dataset that you’ve selected for loading will appear at the top of the screen as a set of filters with drop-down lists. The names of the filters originate from the column titles in your dataset (and likely differ from this manual, depending on your data). The same goes for the categories in the drop-down lists.\n Field 13 - always organism group, Field 14 - always organism species.   There are 2 types of data filters:\n Categorical filters have a drop-down to select from a list of values for filtering (E.g., geographical location, genes present, etc.). Continuous filters (e.g., age, date) are adjusted by sliding a bar on the scale to limit the value range.  For easy selection of the parameters in the categorical filters, there is an option to start typing the text you would like to filter the data by, and this will show you all options containing the given text:\n Filter parameter values   Hierarchical sorting principle Parameters to which the filtering has been applied are marked with a blue box around the corresponding filter drop-down list. Filters are numbered according to their level in the filtering hierarchy (1-12, the lower the number, the higher the hierarchy). When applying the filtering to one of the categories at a higher level, the available filtering options for other lower-level categories may become limited due to filtering applied at a higher-level filter (this is also displayed as a blue box around affected filters).\n Blue box around filters   If you change a higher-level filter, the lower-level filters will be reset.\nExample  Filter was applied to category 1.    After that, the data selection was filtered in category filter #3 to display only 2 geographical locations from the available list:    If after that we go back and modify the selection in category filter #1, e.g., to include one additional value:    We will see that the selection in the category field #3 has been reset to default (to include all available options):     Therefore, as you set your data filtering parameters, it is preferable to apply filters in the order of their appearance on the screen (this does not apply to the fields with continuous data, e.g., patient age).\nIf you wish to keep selected criteria for display, turn on the keep filter option:\n Keep selected criteria for display    The function Keep filters works for drop-down parameters but not for continuous fields (e.g., Date, Age, etc.)   Infographics field There are 7 tabs in the Infographics field that provide different types of data visualization.\nOverall, the infographics field has a general-to-specific structure. This layout facilitates an exploratory approach to your dataset. Meaning, the user doesn’t have to have a preconceived scientific question or target phenomena in mind that they want to investigate, but rather would like to methodically review all facets of their data. Following the organization of the analysis, inherent to the AMRcloud resource, by advancing through the infographics tabs left to right, will help users to form their scientific questions at the more general level of the analysis and proceed to refining and investigating it as they move towards visualization levels focusing on specific data.\n Tab Data structure allows viewing general metadata structure characteristics (proportions of entries with various characteristics, relationships between different data categories, data overlay with a map). Tab Organisms – displays a summary of representation of different species or groups of organisms in the dataset. It may be useful for an initial overview of the dataset and delineation of the further analysis strategy for different species and groups of organisms (e.g., Enterobaterales). Phenotypic resistance can be viewed and analyzed in three tabs: Antibiotic S/I/R Summary, Selected Antibiotic, and Associated Resistance, which are ordered by their level of data granularity starting from a broad overview moving towards more in-depth analysis. Using Infographics tools in that order would prompt the user to start with detecting the concern/interest areas at a big-picture level (general prevalence of resistance to various antimicrobials among different bacterial species, MIC trends, etc.). Then the user would proceed to drill down to unravel potential connections between various types of data: resistance phenotypes vs. metadata (demographic data, geographic distributions, diagnosis, therapy, any genetic or phenotypic properties of the pathogen strains, etc.), as well as associations between individual antibiotic resistance phenotypes (co-resistance, multidrug resistance). Described above types of analysis logically lead to the tab Markers, providing a convenient tool for investigating associations between resistant phenotypes and genetic antibiotic resistance determinants. It can also be used to analyze the correlation between all sorts of genetic markers and any type of metadata. Tab Compare – allows to create two groups with the desired set of parameters and then compare those groups against each other based on various data selected by the user. For example, one could create the first group as community-acquired cases and the second group- as nosocomial cases and then compare the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance, presence of different markers, or any metadata distribution between two groups.  The filtering from the Basic filters field applies to visualizations in all tabs\n To apply filtering from the Basic filters field to the graphics in the Infographics field, press the button Display (the changes made in the Basic filters will not be displayed until you click Display).   Drop-down lists included in the infographics field serve as controllers of what data is presented in a given graph and apply only to the tab they are listed under (unlike filters in the top portion of the screen that include/exclude data for all tabs).\nAfter making the adjustments in the filter fields under the infographics, you need to press the Display button to apply the changes.\nHistograms, pie charts, and area plots generated in various infographics fields of AMRcloud are interactive:\n Hovering over the graph brings a pop-up message showing the name of the data category and percentage of isolates with a given data value. You can change the categories displayed on the graph by clicking on their names in the legend for the corresponding graph. (This does not change relative percentages shown in the graph). E.g., you can hide cases with no data available from the view by clicking on the corresponding data category in the legend.   Changing categories   Understanding of basic connections between loaded data and data filtering/analysis options As mentioned earlier, the names of the headers in your imported data table will be used as the names of the basic filters in the AMRcloud analysis module. When uploading the data, you are asked to mark some of your data fields as Parameters to filter (or Filtration Columns), while others as Markers. Both will be displayed as the Basic Filters for your data. The difference is that the data fields marked as Markers in your original data table will be additionally available for selection under the Markers tab in the Infographics field; this will make it easier to plot those genetic features against the phenotypes (especially SIR categories) as well as other metadata.\nAnother thing to consider, if you have data on multiple genetic determinants that are known to confer resistance to a certain class of antimicrobials, it may be convenient to group them under one category (see detailed instructions in the manual for data upload).\n","date":1633996800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633996800,"objectID":"22ad28634be4f8c6eea3d6d6de7619f1","permalink":"https://amrcloud.net/en/tutorials/analysis-examples/01/","publishdate":"2021-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials/analysis-examples/01/","section":"tutorials","summary":"In the data analysis module, the view is split into 2 fields: Basic filters (top) and Infographics (bottom).

However, after the Basic Filters are modified, the downstream Basic Filters settings will be discarded and would need to be selected again, and the antibiotic name needs to be picked (see chapter Hierarchical sorting principle of this manual for details).\nGeographical distribution of resistance profiles (map visualization)  Set your Basic Filters to select the Organism Species or Organism Group (e.g., Enterobacterales) you wish to analyze. [Species or a group of organisms must be selected for the tasks involving antimicrobial resistance phenotype interpretation due to the species-specific nature of susceptibility breakpoints].

Map   Alternatively, the distribution of relative proportions of isolates resistant to a given antibiotic by geographic locations can be shown by clicking infographics sub-tab Rating (also under Map sub-tab). In the graph below, the prevalence of the selected resistance type in all geographical loci is ordered according to its rate. A vertical dotted line designates a median percentage of resistant isolates.\n Geographical distribution of resistance profiles. Rating   The analyzed dataset can be further sorted by applying additional Basic Filters. However, after the Basic Filters are modified, the downstream Basic Filters settings will be discarded and would need to be selected again, and the antibiotic name needs to be picked (see chapter Hierarchical sorting principle of this manual for details).\nAssociation of resistance phenotype and genotype This type of analysis depends on the data uploaded by the user and can be done using the Markers tab. Specifically, it allows to show MIC distribution for the isolates with different genetic resistance determinants present.\n In the Markers tab, select a group of markers and/or specific markers that you wish to analyze from the corresponding drop-down lists. Select the sub-tab MIC. Select an antibiotic for which you wish to explore the association of phenotype and genotype. Click the button Display. View the histogram of MIC-genetic marker distribution in the infographics MIC below.   Association of resistance phenotype and genotype. Filters   Example of data display. In the provided below example, the presence of carbapenemases correlates with high MIC values of meropenem:\n Association of resistance phenotype and genotype. Result   Associated resistance AMRcloud allows users to explore the association between different antibiotic resistance phenotypes by comparing relative numbers of the isolates resistant to various antibiotics. This information helps to form a better understanding of the general epidemiology of antibiotic resistance and assists with choosing the strategy of antimicrobial prescriptions.\nMatrix of associated resistance To determine whether any co-resistance is observed in the dataset, use the tab Associated Resistance. A good way to start is with known resistance to an antimicrobial present in your isolates; determine the likelihood of that type of resistance to be associated with the resistance to other antimicrobials. For that:\n Set your Basic Filters to select the Organism Species or Organism Group (e.g., Enterobacterales) you wish to analyze. (Species or a group of organisms must be selected for the tasks involving antimicrobial resistance phenotype interpretation due to the species-specific nature of susceptibility breakpoints). Under the tab Associated Resistance, select the sub-tab Coresistance. Click the button Display. View the matrix of associated resistance in the infographics Matrix below.   Associated resistance   Example of data display:\n Associated resistance. Result   In the example matrix above, find the row with the antibiotic to which the resistance is observed in the dataset and which you want to investigate for co-resistance for other antimicrobials, e.g., meropenem.\nValues in the intersections show the likelihood of associated resistance between two drugs being present. E.g., in the example above, there is an 81.49% likelihood that an isolate with resistance to meropenem will also be resistant to gentamicin. Usually, the goal is to find the drug combination with the lowest likelihood value for co-resistance as a potential option for treatment in case of observed resistance to one of the drugs in the pair. Another use of this type of analysis is the detection of unusual resistance patterns, e.g., in the case of resistance of Acetobacter isolates to meropenem, tobramycin has the lowest level of associated resistance among other aminoglycosides.\nMultiple Resistance To calculate the proportion of multi-/extreme-/pan-drug-resistant isolates (as determined by the user) in your dataset, use sub-tab Multiple Resistance. This function allows the user to determine the percentage of isolates that are resistant to at least one, two, … N number of antibiotics simultaneously. The user can specify antimicrobials selected for the analysis.\n Set your Basic Filters to select the Organism Species or Organism Group (e.g., Enterobacterales) you wish to analyze. Select the tab Associated Resistance, Select the sub-tab Multiple Resistance. Pick the antibiotics, among which multiple resistance will be explored. Multiple resistance will only be analyzed among the selected antibiotics (selecting only one antibiotic will not allow analyzing for multiple resistance). Enter the number of antimicrobials to which the simultaneous resistance must be observed in your selected group (user defines the multiple resistance in this analysis). E.g., in the example below, to determine the proportion of isolates that are resistant to all antibiotics in the panel (pan-resistance), select all antibiotics in the dataset (8 out of 8) in the field Antibiotic and set N number to 8 in the field R at least to N antibiotics. Click the button Display.   Multiple Resistance   View the number of isolates meeting the set parameters of multiple resistance. The percentage value from the total number of isolates in the dataset and 95% confidence interval (CI) are also calculated automatically.\n Multiple Resistance. Result   The analyzed dataset can be further sorted by applying additional Basic Filters. However, after the Basic Filters are modified, the downstream Basic Filters settings will be discarded and would need to be selected again, and the antibiotic name needs to be picked (see chapter Hierarchical sorting principle of this manual for details).\nVisualize MIC 50 and MIC 90  Set your Basic Filters to select the Organism Species or Organism Group (e.g., Enterobacterales) you wish to analyze. (Species or a group of organisms must be selected for the tasks involving antimicrobial resistance phenotype interpretation due to the species-specific nature of susceptibility breakpoints). In the Infographics field, select the tab Selected Antibiotic. Under the tab Selected Antibiotic, from the drop-down list, pick the Antibiotic resistance to which you want to explore. Open sub-tab MIC. Click the button Display.   Visualize MIC 50 and MIC 90   In the infographics MIC below, the MIC50 and MIC90 will be displayed as dotted vertical lines above corresponding MIC columns. Hovering over the dotted line will bring out the corresponding MIC50 or MIC90 label:\n Visualize MIC 50 and MIC 90. Result   Time of First Detection of a certain marker in different geographical locations It could be useful to visualize the timeline of occurrence of certain markers- virulence or resistance determinant or a genetic lineage- in different geographical locations available in your dataset. For that, perform the following steps:\n Set your basic filters to include/filter data that you would like to analyze. In the Infographics field, select the tab Markers. Under the Markers tab, chose the group of markers you would like to analyze in the Group of Markers drop-down list. You don’t have to select a specific Marker at this level because you will be selecting the specific marker for visualization later. Open sub-tab Time of First Detection.

To do so, you need to associate the column headers with the standard categories (Isolate ID, Organism Group, Organism Name, and Date) required by AMRcloud. You can also select additional columns with spatial data, other metadata and markers to be used as Fields.\nThe required categories (with brief accompanying instructions) are listed on the left side of the screen. On the right side of the screen, you should choose the corresponding column headers from the drop-down lists. As you proceed with selection, you will be able to preview the content of the first ten rows of each selected column.\n Linking the columns to categories   Isolate ID  This is a mandatory category. Isolate ID can be any combination of alphanumeric characters, except special symbols (?,.!%$#\u0026gt;\u0026lt;).  Organism Group  This is a desirable category. You can use any names for organism groups, full taxonomic (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staphylococcus\u0026rdquo;), non-taxonomic (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staphylococci\u0026rdquo;) or abbreviated (e.g. \u0026ldquo;Staph\u0026rdquo;), however, the names should be consistent throughout the column. Grouping of organisms (species) is useful for analyzing combined prevalence and AST data of several species.  Organism/Species Name  This is a mandatory category. Use Latin binomial names according to official nomenclature (https://lpsn.dsmz.de/). Proper genus and species names are automatically recognized to apply specific breakpoints and to determine susceptibility categories.   Right:\nKlebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (full binomial names)\nWrong:\nK. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa (abbreviated names)\n Select the Species name column from the drop-down list, and press the \u0026ldquo;Check Species Names\u0026rdquo; button to verify the names.\n Checking species names   A list of species names that are not recognized may appear below the button. There may be two reasons for the name(s) to fail the verification process:\n  There are spelling errors (e.g. missing, incorrect letters, etc.). Spell-check the name(s) carefully, correct the error(s) by double-clicking and editing the name(s) directly in the list, then press the \u0026ldquo;Correct species names\u0026rdquo; button.\n  The outdated or invalid species name is used. Try searching the name at https://lpsn.dsmz.de/ or https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy/ and replace it with the correct one.\n   Example #1. \u0026ldquo;Enterobacter aerogenes\u0026rdquo; is the old name for \u0026ldquo;Klebsiella aerogenes\u0026quot;.\n  Interpretive criteria (S/I/R breakpoints) are missing for a particular organism/species in the AMRcloud database. In this case, no correction is needed; species name will be imported \u0026ldquo;as is\u0026rdquo;.   Example #2. The species name \u0026ldquo;Shewanella putrefaciens\u0026rdquo; is correct but is not recognized because breakpoints are currently missing for this species.\n  If the full species name is not recognized, the data import wizard will attempt to determine the genus part of the name and, where possible, will apply the corresponding genus-specific breakpoints to the isolates\u0026rsquo; quantitative AST data. If neither a species nor a genus name is found in the AMRcloud susceptibility breakpoint database, the corresponding isolate record(s) will be imported, but quantitative susceptibility data will not be translated to S/I/R categories.\n Example #3. If \u0026ldquo;Salmonella Typhimurium\u0026rdquo; is used as species name (for \u0026ldquo;Salmonella enterica ser. Typhimurium\u0026rdquo;), the genus-specific breakpoints of Salmonella will be applied.\n   Date  This is a mandatory category. The date format must be consistent throughout the column. Records without a date or with a different date format will not be imported.   Right:\n12.08.2018, 20.05.2017, 16.03.2014 (same format DD.MM.YYYY)\nWrong:\n13.08.2018, 20/05/19, 03/16/2014 (inconsistent format DD.MM.YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY)\n  Incorrect date format   After selecting the Date column from the drop-down list, you should see the time scale under the \u0026ldquo;Date Range Preview\u0026rdquo;. If the date format is not recognized with the Auto option, try selecting alternative date formats. Be sure to check the box when you see the time scale.\n Confirming the date column selection   Spatial Information  This is not a mandatory category. Spatial information includes geographic locations and, optionally, their latitude/longitude coordinates. You may provide various types of objects as geolocations: countries, regions, states, natural areas, cities, smaller locality types or even detailed addresses (e.g. hospital buildings).  Check the box if your data set contains spatial information and select the header of the column with geographic locations from the drop-down list.\nThe coordinates of geolocations can be set automatically or manually at Step Three of the data import wizard. However, if your data table already contains the two columns with latitude and longitude coordinates, check the corresponding box and then select these columns.\n Spatial information   Numeric Parameter  This is not a mandatory category. Only one column containing continuous numeric variable such as \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;, etc. can be selected. If you use a numeric parameter, all cells in the column must be filled in with the number, isolate records (rows) with empty numeric fields are not imported.  Check the box if your data set contains a numeric parameter and select the corresponding column header from the drop-down list.\n Numeric parameter   Markers  This is not a mandatory category. Markers may represent any isolate characteristics (phenotypes, complex genotypes, genes or mutations) that are relevant to antibiotic resistance. Markers can be assigned to groups with each group of Markers set in a separate column. The total number of columns of this type is unlimited.  Check the box if your data set contains resistance markers data and select the corresponding column header(s) from the drop-down list.\n Resistance markers   Additional Parameters  This is not a mandatory category. A maximum of twelve columns with text variables (including the one with geolocations) can be selected as parameters for data filtration and categorization.  Select the corresponding column headers from the drop-down list, drag and sort them with the mouse in the desired order.\n Additional parameters   Completing Step Two Review all the selections made at this step and complete it by pressing the \u0026ldquo;Validate Step Two\u0026rdquo; button.\n   You can reset any saved step and all subsequent steps of the data import wizard by pressing the Reset current and all following steps button.\nTip: There is no need to reset all steps if you only want to apply different interpretive criteria (susceptibility breakpoints) to the existing data set; this can be done by resetting only the Step Four.\n  ","date":1599782580,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599782580,"objectID":"05886ecf74143ea3588b8a15b056aa94","permalink":"https://amrcloud.net/en/tutorials/import-data/05-identification/","publishdate":"2020-09-11T00:03:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials/import-data/05-identification/","section":"tutorials","summary":"This step allows you to select the Column Headers from the imported data table to be used as Fields (or parameters) for data filtration and categorization.

Each isolate record should be represented by a separate row in the table. All AST Data and Metadata should be organized in columns with each column representing only a single type of data (number, date, character string). The Metadata must include four mandatory columns: Isolate Identifier, Organism/Species Name, Organism Group, and Date. All other metadata (e.g. geographical data, resistance markers, etc.) is optional. The AST Data may be of three different types: minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), inhibition zone diameters, and susceptibility categories (S/I/R). Headers of the columns representing AST Data should contain a generic name of antimicrobial agent and one of the three suffixes (\u0026quot;_mic\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;_dd\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;_sir\u0026rdquo;) denoting each type of data.

The quantitative AST Data (MIC and inhibition zone values) for the known antibiotics are automatically interpreted into susceptibility categories using selected criteria (breakpoints).  List of legitimate antibiotic names    Other (arbitrary) names of antimicrobial agents can be used in the column headers, however, for such agents, quantitative AST Data are not translated into susceptibility categories unless you define custom criteria (breacpoints) as explained in Step 4. If you want to use alternative breakpoints for certain antimicrobial agents, you can modify their names as shown in the example below:\n florfenicol_veterinary_mic, marbofloxacin_veterinary_dd\n It is allowed to indicate the load of the disk between the name of the antibiotic and the suffix _dd:\n amoxicillin-clavulanic acid_2-1_dd, moxifloxacin_5_dd\n   The requirements for the format of AST Data entries are as follows:\n  Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Values\n MIC values are measured in mg/L. Values must be numeric. Non-numeric values containing expressions \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; are automatically converted into numeric. Symbols \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; preceding the numbers are removed. Numbers preceded by \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; symbol are multiplied by two.    Disk Diffusion Inhibition Zone Diameter Values\n Inhibition Zone Diameter values are measured in mm. Values must be integers greater than or equal to six.    Susceptibility Category Values\n The only allowed values are \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;. Values such as \u0026ldquo;S/I\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I/R\u0026rdquo; are not allowed.    Additional Metadata In addition to Mandatory Columns and AST Data, your table may include other optional columns with information about sources of isolates (including geospatial data), patient clinical and demographic data, specific characteristics of isolates (including phenotypic and genotypic resistance markers), etc. These columns will be used as parameters for data selection, filtration, and categorization.\nSpatial Information Column(s)\nSpatial Information includes geographic objects (geolocations) and, optionally, their coordinates (latitude and longitude). You may provide various types of objects as geolocations: countries, regions, states, natural areas, cities, smaller locality types or even detailed addresses (e.g. hospital buildings). At Step Three of the data import wizard, an automatic geocoding is performed to assign geographic coordinates to the known geolocations. You can also do it manually if automatic geocoding did not work.\nIf your data table already contains the two columns with latitude and longitude coordinates, you can check the box and then select these columns at Step One of the data import wizard.\nText (String) Metadata Columns\nYou can import a maximum of twelve parameters (columns) containing text metadata (including the column with geographic names) to a single Data Set.\nNumeric Metadata Column\nYou can import one parameter (column) containing continuous numeric variable such as \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;, etc. Please note that if you use a numeric parameter, all cells in the column must be filled in with the number, records (rows) with empty numeric fields are not imported.\nResistance Markers Columns\nResistance Markers may represent any isolate characteristics (phenotypes, complex genotypes, genes or mutations) that are relevant to antibiotic resistance. Markers can be assigned to groups with each Group of Markers set in a separate column. For example, the column with the header \u0026ldquo;ESBL\u0026rdquo; may contain the entries like: \u0026ldquo;CTX-M-15\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;TEM-3\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SHV-2\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SHV-2+CTX-M-15\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;ESBL-negative\u0026rdquo;, etc. You can provide an unlimited number of columns with Resistance Markers. To ensure consistency, the data on Resistance Markers can be presented as follows:\n  Results of testing for specific markers Entries   Positive results \"OXA-48\", \"KPC\", \"CTX-M-15\", \"MRSA\", \"VRE\" etc.   Negative result(s) \"Negative\"   Not tested \"No data\"    Not applicable for a particular organism/species empty cell    Resistance Markers   ","date":1599696300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599696300,"objectID":"02819c3c649b9331fb6128b9b7c6fb19","permalink":"https://amrcloud.net/en/tutorials/import-data/01-prepare/","publishdate":"2020-09-10T00:05:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials/import-data/01-prepare/","section":"tutorials","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;Rules of Thumb\u0026rdquo; for Data Preparation Accurate, well-formated and structured source data is essential for successful analysis using the AMRcloud platform.\n The following \u0026ldquo;rules of thumb\u0026rdquo; should be followed to prepare the data:\n The source data table should include individual isolate records and NOT aggregated statistics.

These infographics will help you overlay and compare any type of metadata uploaded with your dataset; however, it does not include antibiotic susceptibility data, which is investigated in detail in the consequent tabs.\nFollowing visualization tools are available under Data structure (sub-tabs):\nPie Chart Pie Chart sub-tab — simple data distribution by the categories that can be picked from the drop-down list. The table under the graph shows the cumulative data that went into the displayed graph and can be exported in various formats (csv, Excel, pdf, …).\nPlot by Plot by sub-tab — shows data distribution in relation to different criteria set by controllers in this Infographics field:\n Field Plot — the category of data that will be displayed Field Group by — the categories in which the displayed data will be classified into.  Example. Distribution of isolates of different species by years  Distribution of isolates of different species by years    Distribution of isolates of different species by years. Result   Table with cumulative data used to generate the graph is also available below.\nMap Map sub-tab — allows a display of one data category at a time that is set by a drop-down filter.\n To include all data points on the screen, press  To search for the location on the map, use  You can apply markers or drawings by using the side panel on the map  Various adjustments to the elements on the map are available via Style Editor    Style settings   Organisms Tab Organisms – displays a summary of representation of different species or groups of organisms in the dataset (or subset of data selected based on the filters in the Basic Filters filed).\nAntibiotics S/I/R Summary Tab Antibiotics S/I/R Summary displays the overview distribution of the isolates by susceptibility categories S/I/R (which are either entered by the user or calculated from provided by user MIC of Inhibition zone diameter values)\nOnly one organism group or species can be analyzed at once. Before clicking Display, select the Organism Group or Organism Species in the Basic Filters part of the window.\nBy default, the susceptibility categories are displayed for all tested antibiotics (for which the susceptibility criteria are available). You may further select a smaller group of antibiotics (or a single drug) for which you would like to view the S/I/R distributions using the Antibiotic drop-down list in the Plot sub-tab.\nBelow are the controllers of data view available under the Antibiotics S/I/R Summary infographics field:\n A user can choose to show combined data from both auto-interpreted MICs and Zone Diameters together or select one of them under the drop-down list S/I/R Data Source. S/I/R categories can be displayed separately or be combined as S/I+R or S+I/R under the drop-down list Display.  Selected Antibiotic Tab Selected Antibiotic allows to visualize the association of S/I/R categories for each antibiotic with other various factors present in the dataset (e.g., year, genetic lineage, diagnosis, geographic location, etc.). The main goal of this data visualization is to expose the concealed connections between a pattern of antibiotic resistance and any type of provided metadata. This is also the place where you can see antimicrobial susceptibility data distribution by discrete MIC or zone diameter values.\nFollowing controllers of data view are used to adjust data depiction throughout all sub-tabs of the Selected Antibiotic infographics field:\n A user can choose to show combined data from both auto-interpreted MICs and Zone Diameters together or select one of them under the drop-down list S/I/R Data Source. Antibiotic, for which the in-depth analysis is performed, can be selected in the Antibiotic drop-down list. The default selection is the first antibiotic in alphabetical order found in the dataset. Only one antibiotic can be chosen at a time.  Following sub-tabs are available under Selected Antibiotic:\nS/I/R Plots As you open S/I/R Plots, the first set of filters allows you to:\n switch between S/I/R individual categorical view and either S/I+R or S+I/R combined views adjust 95% CI display (most importantly) select the metadata type that will be used for differential analysis of the susceptibility data (viewing susceptibility data distribution based on different metadata categories) – set in the drop-down list Plot by.  The Summary information infographic is displayed first by default and provides the S/I/R summary for the selected antibiotic. (Summary is not affected by the Plot by filter set above).\nExample. Overall ciprofloxacin resistance of Enterobacterales. Let’s say we would like to see the overall ciprofloxacin resistance of Enterobacterales present in the dataset.\nSettings:\n Select the species or group of organisms for which resistance will be explored. Species or a group of organisms have to be selected for performing the tasks involving antimicrobial resistance phenotype interpretation (due to the species-specific nature of susceptibility breakpoints). Pick an antibiotic from the drop-down list, e.g., ciprofloxacin. Select the sub-tab S/I/R Plots. Select the infographics Summary information for the results   Overall ciprofloxacin resistance of Enterobacterales. Filters    Overall ciprofloxacin resistance of Enterobacterales. Result   To proceed with viewing the distribution of antibiotic susceptibility categories (S/I/R) based on various data groups available in the dataset, click on infographics Plot by. Select the type of metadata you would like to use for grouping in the Plot by drop-down list in the level above.\nExample. Prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in different infection types caused by members of Enterobacterales. Let’s say we would like to see the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in different infection types caused by members of Enterobacterales.\nSettings:\n Prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in different infection types caused by members of Enterobacterales. Filters   Results:\n Prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in different infection types caused by members of Enterobacterales. Results   By clicking on colored circles with categories S/I/R under the graph, you can limit displayed categories. E.g., switch to only showing % of resistant isolates by deselecting S and I data:\n Prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in different infection types caused by members of Enterobacterales. Deselecting S and I data   The Table available under the last subtab of S/I/R plots shows the cumulative data that corresponds to the graph displayed in Plot by infographics.\nMap The map with S/I/R data shown as a pie chart for each geographic location appears under Map infographics.\n Selected Antibiotic. Map   The diameter of each pie chart is proportional to the number of isolates. A left-click of the mouse on the diagram shows the geographic location name and absolute and relative number of samples.\nYou may set up an alert value to flag all locations with resistance prevalence above a certain threshold. Example: flag location with \u0026gt;=50% resistance to ciprofloxacin:\n Selected Antibiotic. Map with alerts   Infographics Rating displays the prevalence of the selected resistance type in all geographical loci and orders them according to their rate. Vertical line designates a median percentage of resistant isolates.\n Selected Antibiotic. Rating   Regression analysis of phenotypic susceptibility trends for various geographic locations is available in the corresponding infographics Regression. The generated graph has time points plotted against the X-axis and percentage values for the selected susceptibility categories along the Y-axis.\n Selected Antibiotic. Regression   In the infographics settings, a user has the option to display various susceptibility phenotypes (S, S+I, R, I+R) as well as turn off and on the display of geographical names. Using the sliding scale, one may also adjust the size of circles and smoothing of the graph.\nTo see detailed information for specific geographic locations (particularly, the outlier from general trend), draw a box around values of interest with a left-click of a mouse.\n Selected Antibiotic. Regression. Detailed information.   MIC MIC sub-tab presents antimicrobial susceptibility data as a distribution by discrete MIC or zone diameter values.\nInfographics MIC plots the number of isolates with each corresponding MIC value, as well as MIC 50 and MIC 90 values.\nInterpretive criteria (CLSI or EUCAST) selected upon dataset upload are applied to color-code graph bars for different MIC values: red for resistant isolates, yellow for intermediate, and green for susceptible isolates. If no interpretation criteria are available for a given drug-bug combination, the data bars for the corresponding MIC values will appear grey. It is also possible to have only data bars corresponding to the certain MIC values colored grey- if instead of a single species, the organism group is selected in Basic Filters, and the interpretive criteria for different species (or different infection localizations) within the given group are different for the selected antibiotic.\n Selected antibiotic. MIC   Infographics MIC Trend plots the MIC trend to the specified antibiotic within a given time frame.\nThe generated graph has time points plotted along the X-axis and MIC values along the Y-axis. The size of the circle for each value corresponds to the number of isolates. Color-coding is the same as in the MIC Infographics.\nChecking the flag MIC and adjusting the MIC xx% scale displays the trend of the compiled MIC values:\n Selected antibiotic. MIC trend. MIC90%   To see additional information for the specific MIC values in a given time frame, draw a box around values of interest with a left-click of a mouse and press the button Get Info under the graph. Displayed below information will display the S/I/R distribution for the datapoints encompassed by your selection in the histogram. The table will also include the isolate-level details. The isolates table can be further filtered based on any of the data columns by typing in the value at the top of the column or sorted in ascending/descending order.\n Selected antibiotic. MIC trend. Table   Zone Diameter Zone Diameter sub-tab performs the same function as the MIC sub-tab described above, but for the analysis of antibiotic zone diameters distribution and trends. Similarly, this sub-tab contains Infographics Zone Diameter and Zone Diameter Trend.\nAssociated Resistance Tab Associated Resistance – is a perfect tool for discovering associations between different antibiotic resistance phenotypes. This analysis utility quantifies the number of isolates that are assigned to the category resistant based on applied susceptibility interpretation criteria.\nFollowing infographics sub-tabs are available under Associated Resistance:\nCoresistance The Coresistance sub-tab demonstrated the data on associated resistance as a matrix, where the values in the intersection of two antibiotics show the percentage of cases when resistance to one drug correlates with the resistance to another antimicrobial. Applied heatmap (Matrix infographics) represents the higher percentage of correlation as a brighter red color of the cell.\n Associated Resistance. Matrix   The selection of antibiotics is defaulted to displaying all drugs present in the dataset, but the user may restrict the displayed antimicrobials by using the drop-down list under the Coresistance sub-tab.\nThe same data is also available in Table view under the corresponding tab Table:\n Associated Resistance. Table   Multiple Resistance Multiple Resistance sub-tab calculates the number of isolates that displays correlated resistance against the selected antibiotics.\nSelect 2 or more antibiotics from the drop-down list Antibiotic to see how many isolates possess simultaneous resistance to those antibiotics.\nIn the R at least to N antibiotics, set the value to match the number of the selected antibiotics if you would like to see what portion of isolates is resistant to all of those antibiotics.\nExample If we selected 3 antibiotics: cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem - and then set the number of correlated drug resistance to 3 - it means we will see the number of isolates simultaneously resistant to all 3 drugs - cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem. In the example below, none of the isolates possessed such a combination of resistant phenotypes:\n Multiple Resistance. Example for N = 3   If we set R at least to N antibiotics to 2, this would mean that we would see the number of isolates that are simultaneously resistant to any 2 antibiotics from the selected list (cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and imipenem):\n Multiple Resistance. Example for N = 2   In our example, there are 33 isolates that have such resistance combination out of 135 total tested isolates (value N).\n If the value set in R at least to N antibiotics is bigger than the number of selected drugs under Antibiotic, the number of isolates matching such parameters will be 0, as those are invalid settings.    Value N shows the absolute number of isolates that have the configured resistance combination, displayed in relation to the number of total tested isolates. Value R shows the relative number of isolates resistant to the selected antibiotics (percentage equivalent of the N value). 95% CI is the 95% confidence interval of the relative number of isolates with multiple resistance.  Scatter Plot Scatter Plot sub-tab shows scatter plot of MIC values for 2 selected antibiotics. Select any 2 antibiotics using the drop-down list under this subtab.\nThe number displayed in the intersection between MIC values for 2 different antibiotics corresponds to the number of isolates with such MIC values combination. The circle size is proportional to the number of the isolates with given MIC values and can be adjusted using the scale Point size.\nExample In the example below, we have 12 isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC 128 mg/L and cefotaxime MIC of 256 mg/L.\n Scatter Plot   Markers Tab Markers – can be used for all sorts of genetic markers that you would like to overlay with any type of metadata or antibiotic susceptibility data; the latter is most convenient for investigating correlations between resistant phenotype and antibiotic resistance determinants.\nSelect a group of markers using the Group of Markers drop-down list under the Markers tab. Group of Markers could be any column in your dataset that you marked as Markers while loading the data, and any distinct values in the corresponding column would be considered as individual markers.\nBy default, all values under that group will be displayed, but you can use the Marker drop-down list to limit the displayed values. E.g., below we selected the group of markers - ESBL, and left all possible values to display (in this case only 2 values - positive and negative).\n Markers   Following infographics sub-tabs are available under Markers:\nMarkers Markers sub-tab shows a circular diagram representing a summary of the values available under the selected Group of Markers, i.e., percentage of isolates with each marker value.\n Markers. Graph   Plot by Plot by sub-tab is a convenient tool to investigate the correlations between various markers and any metadata that is present in your dataset.\nTo select the type of data for the analysis categories, use the Plot by drop-down menu.\nExample Distribution of ESBL markers by month:\n Markers. Plot by month   Or by allele clusters (genotyping groups):\n Markers. Plot by allele clusters   Map The Map sub-tab is used to overlay the number of isolates with a given marker on the geographical map.\n Markers. Map   The diameter of the circle for each geographic location is proportional to the number of isolates with the selected marker. The size of circles can be adjusted by dragging the Point Size pointers.\nClicking on the circles will bring a pop-up message showing the name of the geographic location and the number of the isolates.\nMap x2 Map x2 sub-tab differs from the Map sub-tab in the ability to display side by side two maps: one with markers and another one- with a selected antibiotic’s SIR distribution by geographical location.\n Markers. Map x2   Select one antibiotic for the SIR display using the Antibiotic drop-down menu under the Map x2 sub-tab.\nYou can change how SIR categories are displayed on the map using the Category drop-down list and select either of the following: SIR, S+I, R, R+I.\nAny movement or zooming in one map view is automatically applied to another map.\nSIR Summary SIR Summary sub-tab allows visualizing the information on susceptibility categories (SIR) among the isolates with a selected marker(s).\nThe most useful way to review the data would be to select one marker at a time in the Marker drop-down list and look at SIR category distributions for a given marker before moving to the next marker. If all markers are selected, the SIR distribution infographic displays the values for all isolates that have the given marker group values and doesn’t show the difference between different markers.\nThe SIR plot has the percentage of isolates plotted on the Y-axis and SIR categories for the selected antibiotics plotted on the X-axis. The color of the graph bar corresponds to the susceptibility profile:\n S/I/R colors   Example Below is an example with the ESBL marker group:\n Both possible marker values are selected. SIR distribution for all antibiotics is shown:   SIR summary. ESBL    Only the Positive ESBL marker is selected. SIR distribution for all antibiotics is shown:  SIR summary. Positive ESBL     Only the Negative ESBL marker is selected. SIR distribution for all antibiotics is shown:\n   SIR summary. Negative ESBL   MIC MIC sub-tab demonstrates the distribution of the selected markers in relation to MIC values of the selected antibiotic. For this analysis, you may have all or only certain markers selected. However, you would need to select only one antibiotic at a time to display the MIC distributions.\nInfographics MIC shows the histogram distribution with each MIC value of the selected antimicrobial plotted along the X-axis and the percentage of isolates plotted along the Y-axis. The color within each bar indicates the markers, with the height of the block reflective of the proportion of the isolates with a given marker. MIC 50 and MIC 90 values are marked with red vertical lines.\n Markers. MIC   Infographics MIC Trend has dates plotted along the X-axis and MIC values along the Y-axis. Data is displayed for the isolates with the selected marker(s).\n Markers. MIC trend   The color of circles corresponds to the susceptibility category and circle size - to the number of isolates.\nYou can select the circles on the graph for which you want to get more information (by drawing a box around them) and click the button Get Info. The data displayed below will have information on the isolates included in those data points: their MIC values distribution in the MIC tab and metadata - in the Table (Isolates) tab. MIC tab here could be helpful if you would like to see a distribution of MICs in relation to the markers selected for the analysis upstream.\n Markers. Detail information   Zone Diameter Zone Diameter sub-tab pretty much does the same visualization as the MIC subtab, but for AST data available as zone diameters. As with MIC, you may have all or only certain markers selected, but you would need to select only one antibiotic at a time.\nInfographics Zone Diameter shows the histogram distribution with each Zone Diameter value of the selected antimicrobial plotted along the X-axis and percentage of isolates plotted along the Y-axis. The color within each bar indicates the markers, with the height of the block reflective of the proportion of the isolates with a given marker.\nInfographics Zone Diameter Trend displays dates plotted along the X-axis and Zone Diameter values along the Y-axis for the isolates with the selected above marker(s).\nYou can draw a box around the data points for which you want to see more information and click the button Get Info. The data displayed below in the Zone Diameter tab will have Zone Diameter distribution for the selection in relation to the markers selected for the analysis upstream.\nThe Table (Isolates) tab contains the metadata for the isolates included in selection on the Zone Diameter Trend graph.\nTime of First Detection Time of First Detection sub-tab provides visualization of the date of the first detection of a certain marker.\nSelect the marker under the drop-down list Genetic Marker.\nYou can alter what information about the first detection case is displayed on the timeline by selecting different parameters in the drop-down list Plot by. In the case if dates of the first detection are different based on the value of the parameter selected in Plot by, you’ll see multiple date marks on the timeline.\nExample If we select an IIIG lineage of Shigella sonnei in our example dataset as a marker and set the Plot by to geographical location, we will see the dates when this marker was detected in all geographical locations:\n Markers. Time of First Detection   Compare Tab Compare is used to compare two groups defined by the user based on the variety of different parameters (various metadata categories, resistance, presence of markers, etc.).\nA user utilizes the filters to define what parameters do the isolates need to meet in order to be included in one or another group. Group #1 is set using the Basic filters field, and Group #2 is defined using the Filters for Comparison field under the Compare tab - both fields have the same set of filters set at default values at a start, that could be later modified accordingly to define the two comparison groups. E.g., in order to create Group #1, you could filter isolates in the Basic filters field based on prior antibiotics use and only select patients with a recent history of antibiotics prescription. Now, to create Group #2, one could filter the isolates for the second group to only include isolates from patients with no recent antibiotics therapy.\nThe organism group and/or organism species selected by the user for Group #1 will be automatically populated for Group #2 (but not the other way around). Only the group filter is automatically populated.\n Note that after setting the group criteria in the Basic filters field (Group #1) and in the Filters for Comparison field (Group #2), if you go back to modify the selection of parameters for Group #1, the parameters in Group #2 will be reset.   This applies to the selected organism group and species. So if you are planning to restrict the comparison to a particular organism group/species (will be necessary for S/I/R category analysis; see below), it is helpful to set the organism specifics under the Group #1 parameters before applying filters to Group #2 to avoid having to redo your Group #2 filtering. Alternatively, you can always reapply your Group #2 filters if you had to change organism group/species after both Groups have been already defined.\nAfter the two groups were defined, proceed to select the parameters that you want to use as a basis for the comparison of the two groups.\nData structure Data structure sub-tab: you can use any data categories in your dataset as the parameters for the comparison of two groups. Those will be listed in the drop-down list Data Structure by.\nThe top part of the infographics will contain data visualization of your comparison as a bar graph. As with other bar graphs in AMRcloud infographics, you can hide data categories from the view by clicking on them in the legend to the graph. E.g., hiding cases with no data available on complications:\n Compare.

Antibiotic resistance monitoring systems play a key role in observing the antimicrobial susceptibility changes for rational prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Most current systems use data on a global scale; however, local data evaluation is more important for practical application. Unique AMRcloud online platform (https://amrcloud.net) was developed to process user data on antimicrobial resistance. Structural modules are modified to address the needs of researchers. The application has powerful graphic capabilities, data analysis system with automated interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Geocoding is performed in a double way, and information exchange of results is adjusted by user. The use of AMRcloud allows researchers to create their own methodology for organizing primary data and their evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"AMRcloud: a new paradigm in monitoring of antibiotic resistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Administration does not check the reliability of any information provided by you except as expressly permitted by the Terms of Use or Additional Terms and cannot consider its credibility as well as your legal capacity to provide it.
