Antibiotic resistance monitoring systems play a key role in observing the antimicrobial susceptibility changes for rational prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Most current systems use data on a global scale; however, local data evaluation is more important for practical application. Unique AMRcloud online platform (https://amrcloud.net) was developed to process user data on antimicrobial resistance. Structural modules are modified to address the needs of researchers. The application has powerful graphic capabilities, data analysis system with automated interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Geocoding is performed in a double way, and information exchange of results is adjusted by user. The use of AMRcloud allows researchers to create their own methodology for organizing primary data and their evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"AMRcloud: a new paradigm in monitoring of antibiotic resistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":"  Administration does not check the reliability of any information provided by you except as expressly permitted by the Terms of Use or Additional Terms and cannot consider its credibility as well as your legal capacity to provide it.
