Each isolate record should be represented by a separate row in the table. All AST Data and Metadata should be organized in columns with each column representing only a single type of data (number, date, character string). The Metadata must include four mandatory columns: Isolate Identifier, Organism/Species Name, Organism Group, and Date. All other metadata (e.g. geographical data, resistance markers, etc.) is optional. The AST Data may be of three different types: minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), inhibition zone diameters, and susceptibility categories (S/I/R). Headers of the columns representing AST Data should contain a generic name of antimicrobial agent and one of the three suffixes (\u0026quot;_mic\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;_dd\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;_sir\u0026rdquo;) denoting each type of data.    Example Data The basic requirements for the source data table are listed in the Read Me tab of the data import wizard. An example data file for use as a reference for data formatting can be downloaded from a link at the bottom of the Read Me page.\n  Data sample downloading   Basic Requirements The data should be presented in the required format to be handled by AMRcloud.\n The data table should be flat (i.e. it should contain columns and rows with no additional separators, no hierarchical structures).   Data table structure    The first row of the table must be a header row with column names.   Header row    The table should contain four mandatory metadata columns (although the column names may be different):   Isolate Identifier (ID) Organism/Species Name Organism Group Date    Mandatory columns   Isolate ID Isolate ID can be any combination of alphanumeric characters, except special symbols (?,!,%$#\u0026gt;\u0026lt;), and can be non-unique. Records (rows) with empty ID field are not imported.\nOrganism/Species Name Only the official Latine binomial names should be used for microbial species. Abbreviations in the species names are not allowed. Proper genus and species names are automatically recognized to define susceptibility categories to antimicrobial agents using specific breakpoints.\n Right:\nStaphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae\nWrong:\nS. aureus, S. pneumoniae\n Organism Group Any taxonomic or non-taxonomic, full or abbreviated names can be used to define Organism Groups, however the names shoud be consistent throughout the column. Grouping of organisms (species) is used for analyzing combined statistics (e.g. resistance prevalence) of several species.\n Right:\nEnterobacterales, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes, Enterobacterales, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes (all names are standardized)\nWrong:\nEnterobact, Staph, Entbact, Staphylococci, GN anaerobes, Gram-neg anaerobes (names are not standardized)\n Date The import wizard can automatically detect and interpret various Date formats, however, the Date format must be consistent throughout the column. Records without a Date are not imported.\n Right:\n12.08.2018, 20.05.2017, 16.03.2014 (same format DD.MM.YYYY)\nWrong:\n13.08.2018, 20/05/19, 03/16/2014 (inconsistent format DD.MM.YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY)\n   Date format   AST Data The following types of AST Data can be handled by AMRcloud:\n Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) Disk Diffusion Inhibition Zone Diameters Susceptibility Categories (S/I/R)  You can provide unlimited number of columns with AST Data for multiple antibiotics and can include data of different types for the same antibiotic in different columns.\nPlease strictly follow the rules below for naming the columns and choosing the format of AST Data entries.\nHeader of the columns containing AST Data must start with full generic name of antibiotic in English followed by the underscore symbol and must end with one of the three suffixes denoting the type of data:\n         Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations _mic   Disk Diffusion Inhibition Zone Diameters _dd   Susceptibility Categories _sir     Example:\ntobramycin_sir, tetracycline_sir, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid_dd, vancomycin_mic\n The list of legitimate antibiotic names can be downloaded from the link at the Read Me tab of the data import wizard. The quantitative AST Data (MIC and inhibition zone values) for the known antibiotics are automatically interpreted into susceptibility categories using selected criteria (breakpoints).\n  List of legitimate antibiotic names    Note\nOther (arbitrary) names of antimicrobial agents can be used in the column headers, however, quantitative AST Data for such agents are not translated into suceptibility categories. If you want to use alternative criteria (breakpoints) for certain antimicrobial agents, you can modify their names as shown in the examples below:\n amoxicillin-clavulanic acid_clsi_mic, moxifloxacin_clsi_sir, marbofloxacin_veterinary_sir\n   The requirements for the format of AST Data entries are as follows:\n  Minimum Inhibitory Concentration Values\n MIC values are measured in mg/L. Values must be numeric. Non-numeric values containing expressions \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; are automatically converted into numeric. Symbols \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;=\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;=\u0026rdquo; preceding the numbers are removed. Numbers preceded by \u0026ldquo;\u0026gt;\u0026rdquo; symbol are multiplied by two.    Disk Diffusion Inhibition Zone Diameter Values\n Inhibition Zone Diameter values are measured in mm. Values must be integers greater than or equal to six.    Susceptibility Category Values\n The only allowed values are \u0026ldquo;S\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;R\u0026rdquo;. Values such as \u0026ldquo;S/I\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I/R\u0026rdquo; are not allowed.    Additional Matadata In addition to Mandatory Columns and AST Data, you table may include other optional columns with information about sources of isolates (including geospatial data), patient clinical and demographic data, specific characteristics of isolates (including phenotypic and genotypic resistance markers). These columns will be used as parameters for data selection, filtration and categorization.\nSpatial Information Column(s)\nSpatial Information includes geographic locations and, optionally, their coordinates (latitude and longitude). You may provide various types of objects as geolocations: countries, regions, states, natural areas, cities, smaller locality types or even detailed addresses (e.g. hospital buildings). At Step Three of the data import wizard, an automatic geocoding is performed to assign geographic coordinates to the known geolocations. You can also do it manually if automatic geocoding did not work.\nIf your data table already contains two columns with latitude and longitude values, you can check the box and then select these columns at Step One of the data import wizard.\nText (String) Metadata Columns\nYou can import a maximum of ten parameters (columns) containing text metadata (including the column with geographic names) to a single Data Set.\nNumeric Metadata Column\nYou can import one parameter (column) containing continuous numeric variable such as \u0026ldquo;age\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;weight\u0026rdquo;, etc. Pleae note that if you use numeric parameter, all cells in the column must be filled in with the number, records (rows) with empty numeric field are not imported.\nResistance Markers Columns\nResistance Markers may represent any isolate characteristics (phenotypes or genotypes) that are relevant to antibiotic resistance. Markers can be assigned to groups with each Group of Markers set in a separate column. For example, the column with the header \u0026ldquo;ESBL\u0026rdquo; may contain the entries like: \u0026ldquo;CTX-M-15\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;TEM-3\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;SHV-2\u0026rdquo;, SHV-2+CTX-M-15, \u0026ldquo;ESBL-negative\u0026rdquo;, etc. You can provide unlimited number of columns with Resistance Markers.\nTo ensure consistency, the data on Resistance Markers can be presented as follows:\n  Results of testing for specific markers Entries   Positive results \"OXA-48\", \"KPC\", \"CTX-M-15\", \"MRSA\", \"VRE\" etc.   Negative result(s) \"Negative\"   Not tested \"No data\"    Not applicable for a particular organism/species empty cell     Resistance Markers   ","date":1581638700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583840011,"objectID":"02819c3c649b9331fb6128b9b7c6fb19","permalink":"https://amrcloud.net/en/tutorials/import-data/01-prepare/","publishdate":"2020-02-14T00:05:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/tutorials/import-data/01-prepare/","section":"tutorials","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;Rules of Thumb\u0026rdquo; for Data Preparation Accurate, well-formated and structured source data is essential for successful analysis using the AMRcloud platform.\n The following \u0026ldquo;rules of thumb\u0026rdquo; should be followed to prepare the data:\n The source data table should include individual isolate records and NOT aggregated statistics.

Grouping of organisms (species) is useful for analyzing combined prevalence and AST data of several species. Use any name(s) for organism group(s), taxonomic (e.g. Enterobacterales) or non-taxonomic (e.g. Anaerobes, Gramnegative).  Organism/Species Names  This is a mandatory category. Use Latinized binomial names acoording to official nomenclature (e.g. Escherichia coli).

Then user should look through this table carefully:\n If there are errors in some names (for example, a missing letter), user should correct the errors right in the editor window by double-clicking the necessary cell with the left mouse button and pressing the \u0026ldquo;Correct species names\u0026rdquo; button. If there are no spelling errors, it means that there are no microorganisms with such names in the system. Such microorganisms are not excluded from the general data â analysis charts will also be built for them â only they will be colored not according to susceptibility categories, but in a solid gray color. If user works with his own S/I/R susceptibility categories, there will be no problem in identifying microorganism species.   If interpretation criteria for particular microorganism species have not been found, the system will try to apply criteria for the appropriate microorganism group.\n Example. If Salmonella typhi criterias are not found, then Salmonella spp. criterias would be applied.\n   Date  This is a mandatory category. Records without a date or with a varying date format will not be imported.    Wrong date format   If all the dates are arranged correctly and uniformly, user (after selecting the corresponding header from the drop-down list) will see the time scale \u0026ldquo;Date Range Privew\u0026rdquo;.

This project presents the following data on nosocomial A. baumannii isolates collected from various regions of Russia:\n isolate source data (geographical, clinical data, and basic patient demographics); molecular-genetic characteristics of isolates (clonal group, SNP type, sequence type, KL type, presence of acquired carbapenemase genes); susceptibility to various antibiotics; susceptibility to certain lytic phages.  Bacterial isolates The study includes a total of 2,535 consecutive non-duplicate (one per patient/case of infection) clinical isolates collected between 14 January 2013 and 25 December 2018 as part of the national surveillance studies from 61 hospitals in 32 cities of Russia: Arkhangelsk, Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok, Voronezh, Yekaterinburg, Izhevsk, Kazan, Kislovodsk, Krasnodar, Maykop, Moscow, Murmansk, Naberezhnye Chelny, Novosibirsk, Noyabrsk, Omsk, Penza, Perm, Petrozavodsk, Rostov-on-Don, St. Petersburg, Seversk, Smolensk, Tver, Tolyatti, Tomsk, Tula, Tyumen, Ulan-Ude, Chelyabinsk, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, and Yakutsk.\nAntibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibiotics were determined by reference broth microdilution method according to ISO 20776-1:2006. The susceptibility categories were interpreted according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) MIC Clinical Breakpoints v.9.0, 2019 (http://www.eucast.org/clinical_breakpoints/)\nPhage susceptibility testing (PST) Susceptibilities of isolates to selected lytic phages were determined by a modified double-agar-layer method and by spot testing. The results are interpreted as follows: S â lysis by phage; I â partial lysis; R â resistance to phage. PST results are presented together with AST results.\nMolecular-genetic subtyping  All isolates were typed by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing assay based on high-throughput real-time PCR detection of 21informative SNPs in 10 chromosomal loci: gltA, recA, cpn60, gyrB, gdhB, rpoD, fusA, pyrG, rplB, and rpoB (http://snpt.antibiotic.ru:9002/). Selected isolates were typed by both the Oxford and Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) schemes using Sanger or whole genome sequencing (https://pubmlst.org/abaumannii/).  Identification of capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene clusters (K-loci, KL) KL types were identified for selected isolates from WGS data using the standard database and nomenclature (https://github.com/katholt/Kaptive).\nDetection of acquired carbapenemase genes The genes of the most prevalent in Acinetobacter spp. acquired carbapenemases of molecular class D (OXA-23-, OXA-24/40- and OXA-58-like), class Ð (GES-2- or GES-5-like), and class B (VIM, IMP and NDM) were determined by means of real-time PCR.\nStudy group Roman S.

Antibiotic resistance monitoring systems play a key role in observing the antimicrobial susceptibility changes for rational prescribing antimicrobial therapy. Most current systems use data on a global scale; however, local data evaluation is more important for practical application. Unique AMRcloud online platform (https://amrcloud.net) was developed to process user data on antimicrobial resistance. Structural modules are modified to address the needs of researchers. The application has powerful graphic capabilities, data analysis system with automated interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility testing results. Geocoding is performed in a double way, and information exchange of results is adjusted by user. The use of AMRcloud allows researchers to create their own methodology for organizing primary data and their evaluation.","tags":null,"title":"AMRcloud: a new paradigm in monitoring of antibiotic resistance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Administration does not check the reliability of any information provided by you except as expressly permitted by the Terms of Use or Additional Terms and cannot consider its credibility as well as your legal capacity to provide it.
